Python modules for updating barcodes using the ExLibris API. 

This is a single purpose project. It was created to update barcodes 
imported during the migration of Pacific Northwest College of Art records into Alma. This code updates PNCA item records
 by padding barcodes with missing zeros.

Although single purpose the code may be useful for jump-starting future projects.
