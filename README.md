Python modules for updating barcodes. This is a single purpose project for updating barcodes that 
imported while migrating records for Pacific Northwest College of Art into Alma. It updates PNCA item records
 by padding barcodes with missing zeros.

Although single purpose the code may be useful for jump-starting future projects.
